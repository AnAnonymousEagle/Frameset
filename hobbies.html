        By average, I probably spend around 5 hours per day on playing this MOBA game (Mobile Online Battle Arena). I used to play Mobile Legends, but got bored so I switched to Wild Rift. All I could say that the game is both fun and stressful, I'm basically getting the daily dose of adrenaline.

        When my phone is about to die, I waste most of my on playing Roblox. Some would say that it's for kids but in reality, it is not. Roblox is not really a game itself, but there are games inside Roblox that you can play.

        This app is basically saving my ass from the journey of learning a foreign language. It is a foreign language learning app that is quite simple and easy to use (not sponsored). Lately, I've been taking Spanish lessons but in the past I used to take Japanese and Chinese. Overall, a great app when you want to learn a foreign language while not having to read a whole book.
