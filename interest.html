      <h2>My Interests discussion:</h2>
      <h4><b>Foreign Languages</b></h4>
      <p>
        Learning and being fluent in a foreign language is a big ambition to take, that's why Im interested in it. Although difficult to achieve it is extremely useful to know the language of the country you're traveling to. This is also
        the reason why I want to learn Japanese and Chinese. Someday I want to take a vacation in those two countries.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Japanese</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Learning Japanese was something that came natural to me since watching japanese anime has made me do it. Currently, I've forgotten most of the Japanese alphabet *(Hiragana and Katakana) and some Kanji characters but I hope to
              get back to learning Japanese soon. My name is written as <b>"アイバン"</b> in Katakana, it is read as "A-i-ba-n"

        <li>Chinese</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
        <p>
          When I was over the phase of watching animes another phase came to take place. It is the reading of Chinese translated novels. After finishing a few numbers of romance novels I started to take an interest on Mandarin Chinese. My
          thought was like "if I learned Mandarin Chinese then I don't have to read them translated and to fully experience reading chinese novels in a whole different way. Unfortunately the whole "learning a foreign language" stopped
          again.

        <ul>
        <li><p>
          At the current state of my "Foregin Language Learning" the only language I've kept learning to this day is Spanish. All of the language above are spoken in East Asian countries and so learning them is very difficult and it's hard
          to use them practically. Contrastingly, Spanish is commonly spoken in the Philippines, I've also found many words that are very similar to Filipino language, such as the names of the week (Lunes, Maretes, etc.).

      <h4><b>Cooking</b></h4>
      <p>
        Back then I wanted to be a Chef since I love food and so my interest in Cooking started. The only dish I can make at the moment are fried rice and fried foods. Hopefully in the future I will be able to recreate my mom's cooking and
        her delicious recipes.
